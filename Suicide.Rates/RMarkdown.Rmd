# Project Overview

This report looks at a global suicide rate over time, and differing by sex. The purpose of this
report is to inform an audience interested in the mental health field about suicide rates across the globe. 
We answer questions such as what regions have the lowest and highest suicide rates? and if there is a difference
between male and female suicide rates.

## Audience

Our target audience shall be people who are interested in the mental
health field. This data displays the differences in suicide rates by country
and sex, allowing the audience to make inferences about the effects of
certain pressues that cause the most suicidal tendencies.

## Data
The dataset we are working with is a WHO dataset about suicide rates
across time all over the world. The WHOs Mental Health and Substance
Abuse Department collected the data, and we accessed it through their
website. They record suicide rates, substance abuse rates, and other
mental health related data throughout the world.
