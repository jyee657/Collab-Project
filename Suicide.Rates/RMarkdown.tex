\section{Project Overview}\label{project-overview}}

This project looks at global suicide rates over time and differs by sex.
The purpose of this report is to inform and educate an audience
interested in the mental health field and statistics in suicide rates
across the globe. We answer questions two questions that refer to the
dataset and include a summary of the world map that visualizes the
suicide rates globally.

\hypertarget{audience}{%
\subsubsection{Audience}\label{audience}}

Our target audience are individuals who are interested in the mental
health field, specifically those who are interested in how suicide rates
are affected by different environments in the world. This data displays
the differences in suicide rates by country and sex, which allows the
audience to make observations and inferences on how the effects of
different societal pressures contribute to suicidal tendencies.

\hypertarget{data}{%
\subsubsection{Data}\label{data}}

The dataset we are working with is derived from the World Health
Organization and comprises of data on suicide rates across time all over
the world. The World Health Organization's Mental Health and Substance
Abuse Department collected this data and it can be accessed publicly
\href{https://apps.who.int/gho/data/node.main.MHSUICIDEASDR?lang=en}{here}.
This specific department records suicide rates, substance abuse rates,
and other mental health related data throughout the world.

\hypertarget{questions}{%
\subsection{Questions}\label{questions}}

For this project, we will be asking two different questions:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  What countries have the highest and lowest suicide rates?
\item
  Is there a difference between male and female suicide rates?
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{structure}{%
\subsection{Structure}\label{structure}}

Our application is structured so that each tab has a visualization of
the dataset. The \textbf{`World Map'} tab encompasses data across the
world in the form of a global map with color gradient to emphasize how
high and low countries all across the world are in terms of suicide
rate. The \textbf{`Gender Rates'} tab specifically observes the
differences in suicide rates by gender by plotting a bar graph with
different color. Lastly, the \textbf{`Country Rates'} tab displays an
interactive plot that the audience can use to select different countries
and exhibit a line graph for the selected countries.

\hypertarget{further-analysis}{%
\subsection{Further Analysis}\label{further-analysis}}

Upon analyzing the dataset, we had reached the conclusion that
