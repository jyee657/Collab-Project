## Further Analysis

Upon analyzing the dataset, we have noticed a notable pattern of high suicide 
rates in East Asia, specifically countries such as South Korean, Japan, and 
China. This pattern can be observed by using the **'Map'** because it shows 
that the percentage of blah blah blah. 

A few broader implications of this insight can be due to several reasons: 

- Bullying. Cyber bullying is a major problem that East Asian youth are victims 
to. Young East Asians often do not have any support or a way to vent, leading 
to suicide being the only option. 

- The competitiveness within both school and work-life. Education in East Asian 
schools are very rigorous and does not end when school is out. After 
school studying and tutoring sessions can last until 12 AM only to repeat the 
next day, which is the reality for Korean students.

- Lack of mental health support. There continues to be stigma and negative 
connotations mentally ill or struggling individuals. Going through depression 
or any other disorders could make these people feel alienated and lonely, which 
makes it easier to spiral into contemplating suicide.

### Data Quality + Future Ideas

The quality of this dataset seems to be reasonable, especially considering the 
source is from the World Health Organization, which is reputable and notorious 
for giving unbiased data. Rather than harming certain populations, this dataset
is raising awareness of populations that are already hurting themselves and the
reality that even a low suicide rate is still extremely unfortunate and sheds 
light to mental health disparities and the consequences of those issues.

In terms of future ideas and how this project can be advanced further, it would 
be a great idea to include more factors such as hours worked within a day, education, and economic/financial stability so that we can observe these
patterns in greater depth.
